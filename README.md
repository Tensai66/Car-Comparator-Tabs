Created a dynamic single page app for GUI to compare car model with price which also has error checking through React validation which is a spin-off of jQuery Validation plug-in specifically for React. 

This version also includes being able to add tabs and use sliders for input values that updates dynamically.

This is because React has a virtual DOM which modifies the actual DOM rather than vanilla JS which directly modifies the actual DOM. I did not want to mess up the state of the DOM by modifying the actual DOM without the virtual DOM knowing.
